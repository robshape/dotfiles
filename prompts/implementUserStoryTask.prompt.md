# Implement user story task

Read all documents, instructions, and documentation. Then create a plan for implementing ${input:userStoryTask}. I will review your plan and provide feedback. After I approve the plan, proceed to implement it. I will test and review the implementation when you are done. Do not proceed with the next task until I have validated the implementation and approved the reviewed code.
